# Web Worker 
A web worker is a feature of modern web browsers that allows scripts to run in the background without blocking the main user interface thread. It enables developers to write multithreaded web applications that can perform tasks such as heavy computations, network operations, or other types of I/O operations, without affecting the responsiveness of the UI.

Web workers run in a separate thread, which means they can execute code in parallel with the main UI thread. This is useful for time-consuming tasks that could potentially slow down the application's response time, such as complex algorithms, image or video processing, and so on.

Web workers communicate with the main thread by sending and receiving messages. This messaging system ensures that the data is passed between the two threads in a safe and controlled way. Web workers can be created using the JavaScript `Worker` API, which allows developers to spawn new threads and pass scripts to be executed in the background.
