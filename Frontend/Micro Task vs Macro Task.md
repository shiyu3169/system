In JavaScript, tasks are executed in either the micro task queue or the macro task queue.

Micro tasks are tasks that have a higher priority and are executed as soon as the current execution context is finished. Examples of micro tasks include promises, mutation observer callbacks, and process.nextTick().

On the other hand, macro tasks are tasks with a lower priority and are executed after the current execution context is finished. Examples of macro tasks include setTimeout, setInterval, requestAnimationFrame, and UI rendering.

When a task is added to the micro task queue, it is executed before any other tasks in the macro task queue, even if the micro task was added after a macro task. This means that if you add a micro task in response to a macro task, the micro task will be executed before the next macro task.

Understanding the difference between micro and macro tasks is important in JavaScript, especially when dealing with asynchronous code. By understanding the task queue, you can write more efficient and predictable code.
