# Computer Memory and Storage

## Memory

### RAM
RAM (Random Access Memory) is a type of memory that stores dte temporarily while your computer is running. It's fast and flexible, juggling all the programs we're running at any given moment. However, RAM is volatile, meaning it loses its stored data when the power is turned off.

Let's explore the different types of RAM, including SRAM, DRAM, and everything in between.

#### SRAM
SRAM (Static Random Access Memory) is a fast and expensive type of RAM used in high-speed applications like CPU aches, where quick access time is crucial. 

#### DRAM
DRAM (Dynamic Random Access Memory) is slower and cheaper than SRAM. It needs to be constantly refreshed to retain data, making it more high-maintenance. There are many types of DRAM, including FPM DrAM, EDO DRAM, SDRAM, and DDR SDRAM with each generation bringing faster speeds and increased efficiency. Many are obsolete, and the common type of DRAM in the market today are DDR variants, like DDR4, DDR5. GDDR is also worth mentioning. It is a specialized type of DRAM optimized for faster data transfer rate, which the GPU needs for its massive parallel processing. GDDR6 is the most widely used today.

### ROM
ROM (Read-Only Memory) is type of memory that retains data even when the power is off. It's non-volatile and used to store essential information, like firmware and the BIOS, that your computer needs to boot up. 

#### Firmware 
Firmware is a type of software stored in ROM that controls how hardware devices communicate with each other. 

#### BIOS
BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) is the first software your computer runs when you power it up. It's responsible for starting your computer, initializing hardware components, and handing control over to the operating system.

## Storage
### HDD
Hard Disk Drives (HDD) have been around for a long time. They store data on spinning magnetic disks and are known for their large storage capacities at a low price.

### SSD
Solid State Drives (SSD) uses NAND-based flash memory, providing faster data access, reduced power consumption, and increased durability compared to HDDs, but come at a higher price. 

#### NVMe
NVMe (Non-Volatile Memory Express) is a high-performance interface for SSDs that connects directly to the CPU via PCIe lanes. This allows for lower latency and significantly faster data transfer rates compared to SATA-based SSDs. 

### Flash Drives
Flash Drives, also known as USB drives or thumb drives, are small, plug-and-play devices you can use with any USB port. They're easy to use and perfect for transferring files between computers.

### SD Cards
SD cards are commonly found in cameras and smartphones. They're smaller than a postage stamp but can store thousands of files. SD cards come in three main physical sizes: SD, microSD, and miniSD.
