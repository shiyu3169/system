# Top 8 Most Popular Network Protocols

Every day, over 5 billions people use the Internet generating exabyte of data. What makes this massive data exchange possible? Let's explore the network protocols that act as the hidden engines powering our digital world.

## HTTP - The backbone of web development

HTTps uses a request response model. Client makes requests to servers for resources like pages images or API data. Server send back responses with status code like 200 okay, 404 not found, or 500 internal server error. The requested data will return in the response body. HTTP defines methods like get, post, put, and delete that trigger different operation on the server. For example, get retrieves data, form submits form data, and delete removes resources.

## HTTPS

HTTPS builds on HTTP by adding encryption through transport layer security(TLS). TLS allows the browser and server to establish an encrypted connection like two people agreeing on a secret code. This encrypted connection keeps data confidential as it travels over the public internet. Traffic is scrambled, so it's meaningless to anyone intercepting it. TLS also verifies the server's identity. This prevents crooks from impersonating legitimate sites in what's called a man in the middle attack, so TLS provides encryption and authentication that powers https and secure websites. Understanding it allows proper https configuration for safety which is essential for critical user cases like Banking and e-commerce

## HTTP/3

HTTP/3 aims to improve speed and security and fix some nagging performance issues with previous versions. HTTP 3 uses QUIC built on UDP rather than TCP. This optimizes performance without TCP overhead quick minimizes lag when switching networks on a smartphone. Leaving the house or office will have less slowdown. QUIC eliminated head-of-line blocking where one lost packet store steams behind it. Now other steams don't wait for a store one. QUIC speeds up the initial connection setup, it combines cryptographic and transport handshake into one action. Clients can skip round trips for severs they've connected to before. This 0-RTT resume is much snappier. Additionally, QUIC brings encryption by default at the transport layer. All connection data is encrypted. not just the application payload, even metadata like packet numbers gets scrambled. For modern apps, every millisecond counts, HTTP/3 delivers data fast.

## Websocket

Shifting to real-time communication, websocket is a game changer. Unlike HTTP, websocket provides full duplex by directional communication on a single TCP connection. Websocket enables seamless real-time collaboration and live data streams. The initial websocket handshake reuses the existing TCP connection that messages can flow freely in both directions with minimal framing. Websocket supports sending small messages with very low overhead. Ideal for chat, gaming or realtime updates. Encryption via TLS is supported for security.

## TCP & UDP

TCP and UDP provides the essential transport layer foundation for many of the application protocols we've covered. HTTP and websocket are build on top of TCP. They rely on TCP's reliable transmission, order data delivery, and congestion control to smoothly exchange messages and keep realtime connections stable. The newer HTTP/3 utilizes UDP via the QUIC protocol. This allow optimized performance by reducing overhead compared to TCP, however UDP lacks reliability, so HTTP3 adds checks to prevent corruption.

### TCP

Now diving deeper, TCP prioritizes reliability over raw speed. Feature like error checking, transmission control, and ordered data delivery ensure robust performance. TCP adapts to network conditions with flow control, and retransmissions. On the

### UDP

On the flip side, UDP focuses on speed over reliability. With very lightweight error checking and no handshakes, TDP minimizes overhead for user cases like gaming, voice, internet of things, and steaming, however UDP data can be corrupted by drop packets combining UDP with application layer integrity checks balances speed and reliability

## SMTP & FTP

Now moving back up the protocol stack, SMTP and FTP provide application layer standards for email and file transfer respectively. SMTP is the standard for transferring email messages between email servers. Understanding SMTP helps properly configure mail services and avoid issues like deny listing. FTP allows efficient uploading and downloading of files between hosts. It remains ubiquitous for file based workflows especially for financial institutions.

## Summary

Understanding these proper protocols equips us to build fast secure systems.
